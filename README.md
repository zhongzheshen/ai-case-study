## Title

Artificial Intelligence And Its Application at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital

## Overview and Origin

The concept of artificial intelligence has been with us for several decades while only draw the masses’ attention since less than 50 years ago, especially after OpenAI released its GPT in 2018.

Thanks to the significant contributions from individuals like Alan Turing, Marvin Minsky, Dean Edmonds, Arthur Samuel, Frank Rosenblatt, John McCarthy, Oliver Selfrodge, Daniel Bobrow, Joseph Weizenbaum, Terry Winograd, Danny Hills, Judea Pearl, Peter Brown, Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengo, Patrick Haffner, Sepp Hochreiter, Jurgen Schmidhuber, Fei-Fei Lee, Rajat Raina, Anand Madhavan, Andrew Ng, Geoffrey Hinton, IIya Sutskever, Alex Krizhevsky, Ian Goodfellow, Diederik Kingma, Max Welling, Stephen Hawking and large orgnizations and companies such as IBM, Stanford Research Institute, University of Montreal, Apple, Google, Facebook, DeepMind, Uber, Groove X, Microsoft, the University of Oxford, the university of California, san Diego, Intel, NVidia and many others, the AI started and has been reshaping almost all aspects of our lives.

One example is the Fintech, such as using our mobile phone for banking activities. The following statistics shows the revenue trend of the AI application in Fintech domain. [2]

The same trend can be seen everywhere including the healthcare systems. Here I would like to introduce the NewYork-presbyterian Hospital where I work currently. [12,13]

The NewYork-Presbytarian Hospital is a nonprofit, world-class academic medical center in New York City affiliating with two Ivy League medical schools, Well Cornell Medicine at Cornell University and Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. It committed to excellence in patient care, research, education, and community service and is one of the nation’s largest and most comprehensive hospitals and a leading provider of inpatient, ambulatory, and preventive care in all areas of medicine.[3,4] 

The oldest part of the NewYork-Presbytarian Hospital was founded in 1771 by King Goerge III of Great Britian. After that, it was expanded significantly along the years and its endowment was grown to more than $20 million in 1927. It was officially formed in 1998 after the merge of two large, previously independent hospitals, the New York Hospital and Presbyterian Hospital, and became the largest in New York [4]

In the 2010s, the hospital began to supplement its physical presence with remote and online services. A telemedicine service allows patients to receive follow-up care remotely, a CAT-equiped ambulance allows stroke care to take place outside the hospital, and a remote second opinion program uses Grand Rounds technology. [4]

On Nov 27, 2017, the hospital announced the built up of its Network-Presbyterian’s AI Command Center where registered nurses use artificial intelligence to monitor what’s happening at the hospital. [5]

On Nov 5, 2019, NewYork-Presbyterian moved forward to leverage advanced technologies like autonomous robots, artificial intelligence and robot process automation at its Phonix campus and expecting to save 10 to 11 million dollars in 2020. {6]

On Dec 11, 2023, NewYork-Presbyterian wrote out its implementing artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, after being more confident for the benefits, where it was closely linked to the core of the health system. Among the about 120 AI initiatives across the clinical and nonclinical areas in the hospital, some areas were specially addressed by Peter Fleichut, group SVP and chief transformation and information officer[7,8,9]:

  -	Identify Diseases Early. 
 
    “There is an unbelievable promise in being able to use data and AI to identify patients that may have illness earlier in the course of their treatment,” A NewYork-Presbyterian cardiologist, for instance, is working with data scientists to develop an algorithm that can identify weather a patient has heart conditions like structural heart disease during an electrocardiogram. Usually, such a patient would need a “much more complex” test like an echocardiogram ultrasound. Now we can use AI to get that ultrasound sooner and ultimately, and treat him/her at the heathier stage which leads to a better outcome. 

    The goal is to be able to develop similar algorithm for other diseases as well.

  -	Navigate the Healthcare Industry.
 
    Healthcare Brew covers pharmaceutical developments, health startups, the latest tech, and how it impacts hospitals and providers to keep administrators and providers informed.

  -	Automated Timekeeping.

    With roughly 40, 000 employees, it can be a complex process for the hospital to track when each employee clocks in and out. Using robotic process automation streamlines the timekeeping process is very basic but will be very impactful.

  -	Implementing AI Ethically
 
    As NewYork-Presbyterian rolls out its AI strategy, ethics are top of mind. The health system has put in place a process to review all new technologies for cybersecurity concerns and algorithmic biases. 

    For example, the health system found bias in an algorithm used by some hospitals to identify eligible patients for a lung transplant. The algorithm was trained with data from 100 years ago, when the lung capacity of Black and white patients was “drastically different” due to historic disenfranchisement and slavery. Using that data could lead the algorithm to have a bias when determining which patient should be prioritized for a transplant. “When we look at AI, we want to make sure it’s being built off of diverse datasets.”

    Part of implementing AI ethically is also making sure patients understand when the technology is used during care. “We want to be transparent about where we are and aren’t using technology”.

  -	Communication with Patients.

    NewYork-Presbyterian has added training to help providers communicate with patients about how AI may be being used in clinical care. Besides, the health system also tests new technology and collect patient feedback before the tech is officially introduced to patients. 

NewYork-Presbyterain was named a top 10 most innovative company in AI for 2018 by Fast Company [10].
Obviously, its strategy is to adopt more AI technologies to help its unique strength of having the most best doctors in order to win the competitions with such as Mount Sinai Health System, Bronxcare health System, Maimonides Medical Center, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. [11]

Being an engineering expert for biomedical imaging equipment service, I believe my unique background having special advantage to join the effort of identifying disease early mentioned above. Hope this AI Boot Camp training will bring me to where I want to go. 

Regarding being my best at work, I currently have a recommendation for the hospital. The facilities cooling water has significantly impact on the efficiency and safety to all clinical units. Ideally developing an algorithm using already in-hands data for an AI robot learning to find out the weakest points across the old buildings’ water pipe circuits and predict the cost-effective options for improvement should be  practical when the funding is limited.
